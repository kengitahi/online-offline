# Online/Offline App

## About Online/Offline

This is a simple app that saves data to MySQL when the user is online and to sqlite when they are offline. If they save data when offline, the data is automatically synced to the MySQL database when they get back online.

The app also features custom toast messages that alert the user of their connection status when they open the page. 

These messages also alert them when they go offline and came back online, as well as when data is being synced, after synchronization is complete, and when there are no posts to sysnc if they were offline and came back online.

## Tech Stack
- Laravel
- Tailwind CSS
- Livewire backend validation and post creation
- Alpine.js for network status detection and creating the toast messages
